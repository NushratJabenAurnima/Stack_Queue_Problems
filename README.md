## Problem 1
**Write a program to find Largest Number Using Dynamic Memory Allocation from a list of 
elements. You have to input total size of elements and depending upon the number of 
elements, the required size has to be allocated using DMA. 
Example:**

**Input size of array: 5**

**Array element: 1 2 3 4 5**

**Expected Output: 5**

## Problem 2
**Given an integer k and a queue of integers, write a program to remove the first k elements 
of the queue, reverse their order and append them at the end of the queue, leaving the 
other elements in the same relative order.**

**Only a stack can be used as an auxiliary space and the following standard operations are
allowed on queue.**

**• enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue**

**• dequeue() : Remove an item from front of queue**

**Examples:**

**Input: Q = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, k =5**

**Output: Q = 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10**

**Input: Q = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, k =2**

**Output: Q = 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 20, 10**
