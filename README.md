## Problem 1
**Write a program that creates a Queue from a stack. After creation the top of the stack 
will be the front of the queue.**

**Input Data-**

**S: 1 2 3 4 5**

**Output Data-**

**Q: 5 4 3 2 1**

## Problem 2
**Given an integer k and a queue of integers, write a program to remove the first k elements 
of the queue, reverse their order and append them at the end of the queue, leaving the 
other elements in the same relative order.**

**Only a stack can be used as an auxiliary space and the following standard operations are
allowed on queue.**

**• enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue**

**• dequeue() : Remove an item from front of queue**

**Examples:**

**Input: Q = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, k =5**

**Output: Q = 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10**

**Input: Q = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, k =2**

**Output: Q = 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 20, 10**
